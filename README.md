# discrete_optimization

Integer Programming group project

The repo has two directories: ampl/knapsack_problem_warmup, datasets, notebooks.
Please put ampl files into  ampl/knapsack_problem_warmup and .csv datasets into datasets directory.
Tamon, said that there might be some data wrangling necessary, so the dir notebooks is for jupyter or Rmarkdown notebooks if data viz or clean up is necessary.
